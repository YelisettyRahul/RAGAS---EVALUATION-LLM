Among the novel therapies that have been approved for the clinical management of TNBC, immunotherapy shows great potential. Although exciting progress has been made in immunotherapy for TNBC, there are still gaps to fill. This review will analyze current immunotherapy strategies in TNBC, summarize the current landscape of clinical trials, review the results achieved, and shed light on future developments.'),\n",

       "  'Abstract: Due to the absence of hormone receptor (both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) along with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from endocrine or anti-HER-2 therapy. For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for TNBC is extremely poor. The successful application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) launched the era of immunotherapy in TNBC. However, the current findings show modest efficacy of programmed cell death- (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitors monotherapy and only a small proportion of patients can benefit from this approach. Based on the basic principles of immunotherapy and the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC, immune combination therapy is expected to further enhance the efficacy and expand the beneficiary population of patients. Given the diversity of drugs that can be combined, it is important to select effective biomarkers to identify the target population. Moreover, the side effects associated with the combination of multiple drugs should also be considered.'),\n",

Compared with other subtypes, TNBC is more aggressive, and most patients develop recurrence and metastasis within 3 years, with poor prognosis [2]. Anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for early-stage patients, but resistance has emerged [3]; for patients with recurrence or metastasis, there are even fewer treatment options. There is an urgent need for novel and more effective treatments.'),\n",

First, immunogenicity of tumors is decreased via down-regulation of antigen expression, sequestering of antigens, or downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [12,13]. Second, there are functional and/or quantitative defects in intrinsic and/or adaptive immune cells, including recruitment fail-ure, insufficient maturation, failure to activate, and impaired chemotaxis and transport [14]. Further, an immunosuppressive microenvironment is generated through an increase in the proportion of immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells (Tregs), M2 macrophage cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)) and cytokines, as well as the accumulation of immunosuppressive substances [15,16].

These immunotherapy approaches include: therapeutic cancer vaccines (TCVs), which are active immunotherapies; targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and their derivatives, such as ADCs, adoptive cell therapies (ACTs), and cytokines, which are passive therapies; as well as the best-known ICIs [19].'),\n",

Based on omics analysis, heterogeneity of the TIME in TNBC has been revealed. According to the data from these studies, the percentage of TNBC cases that present with “hot tumors” is approximately 25%, which may explain the poor clinical efficacy of ICIs as single agents [21–23].

Apart from that, more than 100 immunotherapy clinical trials are being conducted on advanced solid tumors, including TNBC. Of note, these are just the tip of the iceberg as there are trials registered on other websites. In addition to observing the surge in clinical trials of immunotherapy for TNBC in the past decade, we further analyzed the data and found that: (1) there are 197 trials involving ICIs that target PD-(L)1, accounting for 84% of all trials, of which only 13 trials involved monotherapy, while in the other trials, PD-(L)1 inhibitors were combined with almost all therapies that can be applied to TNBC; (2) there are considerable numbers of clinical trials in both early and metastatic settings, which demonstrates the generalizability of immunotherapy for TNBC; and (3) there is a gradual increase in the number of window-of-opportunity (WOP) trials to test for optimal timing of interventions and changes in biomarkers.'),\n",

Chemotherapeutic agents also increase the immunogenicity of tumors by exposing MHC molecules and antigens on the surface of tumor cells [37]. The transient immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy causes a massive release of cytokines and chemokines, which increases the infiltration and activation of immune cells [38]. Furthermore, chemotherapeutic agents reduce immunosuppressive cells such as Tregs and MDSCs [39]. These chemotherapy drugs include anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and others commonly used for TNBC. Thus, combining PD-(L)1 inhibitors with chemotherapy is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and facilitate synergistic anti-tumor activity.

However, there are still limitations re-lated to choosing PD-L1 as a predictive marker. First, PD-L1 expression is spatiotemporally variable. It not only evolves over time with disease progression but also varies by metastatic location, with the highest prevalence of positivity in lymph nodes and the lowest in the liver [111]. Moreover, PD-L1 status was found to be less predictive of efficacy in early-stage TNBC compared to late-stage disease, as discussed previously [55,60]. Second, there are a variety of immunohistochemistry assays for PD-L1 expression status detection, but a lack of standard test methods. The five mainstream assays commonly used from two companies are the 22C3, 28-8, and 73-10 assays on the DAKO AutoStainer Link 48 platform and the SP142 and SP263 assays on the Ventana Benchmark Ultra platform. These assays use differ-ent primary antibodies to assess PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and/or tumor-infiltrating immune cells with different scoring criteria and definitions of PD-L1 positivity [112,113]. The 22C3 assay uses a combined positive score (CPS) based on both tumor cells and im-mune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages) staining to determine PD-L1-positive tumors in mTNBC patients for pembrolizumab, with a cutoff value of 10 in KEYNOTE-355. In contrast, the SP142 assay uses the percentage of stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) to the tumor area to determine PD-L1-positive tumors for atezolizumab, with a cutoff value of 1% in IMpassion130. Occasionally, in some trials, the percentage of tumor cells (TC) stained is also used to assess PD-L1 expression [27,57]. It is worth noting that the three scoring systems differ significantly in terms of algorithms and the types of cells evaluated. A comparative study analyzed the concordance between different PD-L1 assays and the relationship with patient clinical outcomes. The results showed poor equivalence between the different assays and they were not analytically interchangeable. SP142 assay ( 1% IC) detected the least prevalence of PD-L1 positivity at 46.4% (74.9% for SP263 ( 1% IC) and 80.9% for 22C3 (CPS 1)), with almost all of these patients captured by the other two assays, and these patients had better clinical outcome improvement with the applica-tion of atezolizumab [114].

In a biomarker analysis of KEYNOTE-119, high TIL levels were related to better clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab, but not with chemotherapy. Patients with TNBC and TILs 5% survived longer with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy, but this difference was not significant [119]. In contrast, IMpassion130 showed that stromal TIL (sTIL) levels were synergistic with PD-L1 expression; when assessed independent of PD-L1, TILs failed to provide prognostic value [111]. A simple method of section staining is recommended to quantify the extent of TIL infiltration [120]. TILs appear to be a promising biomarker for predicting the efficacy of ICIs at a lower cost, but more evidence is needed. Furthermore, in addition to the numerical level, the composition ratio of cellular components, activation status, and spatial location distribution of TILs are additional important factors that deserve further investigation when exploring the predictive effect of TILs on the efficacy of immunotherapy.'),\n",

High TMB has been associated with efficacy benefits for ICIs in various tumors [122,123]. Despite being the highest TMB subtype of breast cancer, TNBC still has a low mutational load compared to other tumors such as melanoma. One study showed that the median TMB in breast cancer was 2.63 mut/Mb and only 5% of patients had high TMB (>10 mut/Mb), with metastatic tumors having higher TMB. Of these, the median mutational burden in TNBC was 1.8 mut/Mb [124]. Data from 149 TNBC patients in the GeparNuevo trial showed a median TMB of 1.52 mut/Mb, and continuous TMB independently predicted pCR [125]. Data from 253 patients in the KEYNOTE-119 trial showed a positive correlation between TMB and clinical response to pembrolizumab, but not to chemotherapy [126]. However, in another study, high TMB failed to predict response to ICIs. In the TNBC subgroup, 10 patients with high TMB (>10 mut/Mb) had an ORR of 0, compared to 20.5% in patients with low TMB. The reason for the immaturity of TMB as a predictor for the efficacy of ICIs is mainly due to the fact that antigens generated by tumor mutations may not be immunogenic [127].'),\n",
       " ('cancers-15-00321.docx',\n",
       "  'In fact, MSI/dMMR is one possible cause of high TMB [128]. Although MSI-high/dMMR has been shown to be associated with immunotherapy efficacy in a variety of tumors and has been approved by the FDA as a biomarker for the application of PD-1 blockers in solid tumors [129–131], its frequency is extremely low in TNBC, even in the high-level TIL subtype [132,133]. Based on the available evidence, MSI-high/dMMR is not a practical biomarker for screening TNBC patients who are or are not suitable for immunotherapy.'),\n",

       "  'The aforementioned biomarkers predict PD-(L)1 blockade responses either from the perspective of the TIME or the tumor itself, but none of them are perfect. For now, the combination of several biomarkers to screen suitable patients may be more reliable. The most critical point in selecting immunotherapy-sensitive individuals and giving the most appropriate therapy is to identify the immune deficiency at the tumor site; this is quite dif-ficult, especially in patients with metastases, as many mechanisms of immune escape may exist. However, with further understanding of tumor immune mechanisms, individualized and precise immunotherapy becomes increasingly possible, especially with the influx of novel genomics, single-cell sequencing, and artificial intelligence technologies.'),\n",

       "  'The unique biological mechanisms of immunotherapy-fighting tumors enable a long-term or even complete response. However, they also require a long response time, which may lead to the emergence of immune-related patterns of pseudoprogression, hyperpro-gression, or a mixed response [134–137]. Pseudoprogression refers to an initial increase in tumor size followed by a decrease of tumor burden, and is associated with immune cell infiltration, edema, or necrosis due to immunotherapy [138]. Pseudoprogression after im-munotherapy for TNBC has been reported [139], but incidence rates based on large samples are lacking. Previous data suggest that the incidence of pseudoprogression in solid tumors is less than 10%, which implies that some patients who present with progression after treatment are likely to have true progression [140]. Although the immune-related response criteria (irRC), immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), and immune RECIST (iRECIST) have been published to assist clinicians in evaluating response to immunotherapy, these are not yet widely used in clinical practice [141–143]. Therefore, in patients presenting with tumor progression after initial immune-based therapy, clinicians must assess patients’ clinical conditions and toxicity responses thoroughly before carefully deciding on subsequent treatments. This is especially important when immunotherapy is used in combination with other therapies that have tumor-killing effects.'),\n",
       " ('cancers-15-00321.docx',\n",
       "  'Along with durable anti-tumor activity comes immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that are distinct from the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy. These irAEs vary according to the type of immunotherapy, but there are some common features among ICIs [144]. First, irAEs are mostly organ-specific, occurring mainly in immune-related organs, with rare cases reported involving multiple organ events at the same time [144,145]. Second, while some irAEs occur rapidly, others are regularly delayed, even after treatment [144]. Finally, there is no clear relationship between irAEs and ICI dose [144,146]. These features remind us that irAEs require long-term management that cannot be limited to the period of dosing. Furthermore, the appearance of some toxicities often requires interruptions or even permanent discontinuation of dosing. The most common irAEs in breast cancer patients are rashes, followed by thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism > hyperthyroidism), and infusion reactions [147]. Although these irAEs are not usually fatal, they often require high-dose corticosteroid treatment, which may lead to a reduced efficacy of immunotherapy along with additional side effects. On the other hand, patients with permanent endocrine organ damage (such as the thyroid) are required to take therapeutic drugs for the rest of their life and their quality of life is therefore compromised. Notably, the current addition of PD-(L)1 inhibitors to conventional therapies in TNBC patients has already increased the incidence of associated irAEs, although severe incident rates are less than 10% [147–149]. Lessons from other tumor types show us that some novel immunotherapies, as well as combination treatments with immunotherapies, can lead to a higher incidence of irAEs and even severe cytokine release syndromes [150–152]. Therefore, the introduction of novel immunotherapies and new combination regimens is something that should be given extra attention. Early identification and management of irAEs is extremely important. Of particular consideration is the impact of immunotherapy on fertility, as a significant proportion of patients with TNBC are younger than 40 years of age.'),\n",

       "  'TNBC is the subtype of breast cancer with the worst prognosis. To date, although several targeted drugs have been approved for the treatment of TNBC, the urgent need for improved survival has not been met. The practice of immunotherapy in TNBC is just beginning to take off. An advantage of the later start in this field is that experience can be learned from other tumor types, both successful and failed. Although some progress has been made with respect to ICIs for TNBC, many challenges remain. Clinical results show that only a small proportion of patients with TNBC actually benefit from immunotherapy. Thus, identifying the target population and expanding the efficacy is a top priority. Overall, combination treatment is the way forward, but the combination treatment mode, sequence,'),\n",

TNBCs lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and express low levels of HER2, and therefore do not respond to hormonal or anti‑HER2 therapies. TNBC is a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer that generally displays poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC is chemotherapy sensitive, and this treatment remains the standard of care despite its limited benefit. Recent advances with novel agents have been made for specific subgroups with PD‑ L1+ tumors or germline Brca‑mutated tumors. However, only a fraction of these patients responds to immune checkpoint or PARP inhibitors and even those who do respond often develop resistance and relapse. Various new agents and combination strategies have been explored to further understand molecular and immunological aspects of TNBC. In this review, we discuss clinical trials in the management of TNBC as well as perspectives for potential future treatments.'),\n",

TNBCs are comprised of at least four distinct transcriptional subtypes: Two basal subtypes, BL1 and BL2; a mesenchymal subtype M, which is devoid of immune cells; and a luminal androgen receptor (AR) subtype LAR (1,2). TNBC is also subdivided into 6 different subgroups based on molecular heterogeneity: Basal‑like; mesenchymal‑like; mesenchymal stem‑like; luminal AR expression; immunomodulatory; and unstable type (6). TNBC represents approximately 15‑20% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers and is generally a more aggressive disease with a poorer prognosis and higher grade than other types of breast cancer, accounting for 5% of all cancer‑related deaths annually. The median overall survival (OS) for the disease is 10.2 months with current therapies, with a 5‑year survival rate of ~65% for regional tumors and 11% for those that have spread to distant organs (7,8).'),\n",

However, TNBC also displays a high level of programmed cell death‑ligand 1 (PD‑L1) expression (12,13). Thus, immunotherapies targeting the programmed cell death‑1 (PD‑1) receptor/PD‑L1 pathway that maintains immu-nosuppression in the tumor environment in TNBC have been explored and atezolizumab (anti‑PD‑L1 antibody) in combi-nation with nanoparticle albumin‑bound (nab)‑ paclitaxel was approved as a first‑line therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the IMpassion130 trial (NCT02425891) in 2019. This immuno ‑chemotherapy became SOC for patients with PD‑L1+, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. Note that the survival benefit was exclusively in PD‑ L1+ TNBC patients. The threshold is 1% PD‑L1 expression on infiltrating immune cells by an approved companion diagnostic SP142 IHC assay and 41% of enrolled patients showed PD ‑L1‑positive expression in the IMpassion130 trial. This is in contrast to studies in other types of cancer which showed benefit for checkpoint inhibitor therapy even in patients with negative PD‑L1 expression. In the first interim analysis of IMpassion130, the median PFS was 7.5 vs. 5.0 months with chemotherapy and the median OS was 25.0 vs. 15.5 months with chemotherapy among patients with PD ‑L1+ tumors (14). In the pre‑specified second interim analysis (data cutoff January 2, 2019), the median OS was 25.0 vs. 18.0 months with chemotherapy. Overall, the combination was well‑tolerated and immune‑related adverse events (AEs) included rash, hypothyroidism, and pneumonitis (15). Another immunotherapy, pembrolizumab (anti‑PD‑1 antibody), was approved in 2017 as a histology agnostic immunotherapy in all microsatellite instability‑high (MSI‑H) and/or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors.

Olaparib was associated with a 42% increase in median PFS as compared to the control group (7 vs. 4 months) in gBRCAm HER2‑negative meta-static breast cancer patients with previous chemotherapy (21).

Gene expression analysis and functional studies have revealed a high degree of plasticity and heterogeneity in luminal and basal‑like tumors. Expression of ERα, FOXA1 or GATA3 can result in transition from basal‑like breast cancer to luminal type whereas epigenetic reprogramming can result in a reverse tran-sition (109 ‑111). The CDK2‑EZH2 axis in tumors with TNBC phenotype (i.e. basal‑like breast cancer) has been explored for conversion to the ERα+ subtype. Epigenetic enzyme EZH2, a histone‑lysine N‑methyltransferase that promotes histone H3 lysine 27 mono‑, di‑ and tri‑methylation (H3K27me1/2/3), drives transcriptional repression (112,113).

However, Phase II study (NCT01349959) in patients with advanced hormone‑ resistant breast cancer or TNBC revealed that combination of DNMT inhibitor 5‑azacitidine and HDAC inhibitor entinostat did not induce ERα expression and primary endpoint ORR was not met (118).

       "  'Developing novel treatments in both early and advanced TNBC settings remains a significant unmet need. Recent advances with novel agents have been made for specific subgroups with PD‑L1+ tumors or gBRCAm tumors. However, only a fraction of those patients respond to immune check-point or PARP inhibitors, and even those who do respond often develop resistance and relapse. In diverse tumor microenvironments, a given therapeutic agent shows vari-able responses, thus compromising the survival endpoints especially in an unselected TNBC population. Therefore, developing novel predictive biomarkers are crucial for selecting patients that will benefit the most from a given therapy. Single cell technologies will provide additional insight on tumor‑stroma interactions and facilitate compel-ling rationale for new treatments based on novel biomarkers. A non‑invasive testing of plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and CTCs can potentially provide real ‑time disease monitoring and even early therapy modification. However, their prognostic value needs further evaluation. With recent advances in multiomic analyses of cancers, there appears to be genomic and molecular similarities between TNBC and high ‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), suggesting that similar biological mechanisms drive some aspects of both cancer types. Therefore, treatment strategies for HGSOC can be explored in TNBC as well. The recent increase in the number of clinical trials investigating various new agents and combination strategies reflects further efforts to under-stand molecular and immunological aspects of TNBC. This may lead to more meaningful clinical benefits, including event‑free and overall survival.'),\n",
